## Usage

The suite is designed to be very easy to use with minimal dependencies. You only need `curl`, `ping`, and a basic shell. It works on most Linux systems and macOS, though your experience may vary.

Use this command to grab the script and run it:

```bash
curl -fsSL [https://wstr.codes](https://wstr.codes) | bash
