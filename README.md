# Suite of Tools
This is a simple, purpose-built suite of tools that I created for my various IT needs. Currently, this suite only includes a networking tester, but more tools will be added later. Thank you for using my tool!

## Usage
The suite is designed to be very easy to use with minimal dependencies. You only need `curl`, `ping`, and a basic shell. It *should* work on most Linux systems, though your experience may vary.

Use this command to grab the script and run it:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://wstr.codes | bash
```

## Features

- Basically no dependencies
- Scoring out of 100
- Launcher script
- Works with *most* Linux distros (Mac testing soon!)
